/* What each plan is allowed to do.
 *
 * One table, no scattered `if (isPro)` checks. Every gate in the app asks this
 * module, so the answer to "what does Plus/Pro actually get?" lives in one
 * place a person can read — and so a marketing page, a paywall modal and the
 * code that enforces it can never disagree about it.
 *
 * Two rules shaped this list, and both are worth stating because they are easy
 * to violate later under revenue pressure:
 *
 *  1. **Nothing that already shipped free becomes paid.** Tasks, exams, the
 *     timer, flashcards, quizzes, notes, spaced repetition, the study room,
 *     friends — all of it stays free forever. Taking working features away
 *     from students who already rely on them is how you lose the trust this
 *     product needs, and the people we are building for are the least able to
 *     pay their way back in. Every AI tool below keeps a real (if small) free
 *     allowance for the same reason — the free tier tries every tool, it just
 *     runs out of runway on the ones it uses hardest.
 *  2. **The free tier has to be genuinely good.** A student who never pays
 *     should still get a real study system. Plus and Pro buy leverage on top
 *     of a complete product, not a product held hostage.
 *
 * Plus and Pro sell the same two things, at different amounts: headroom to
 * use the AI as hard as a serious student wants to, tool by tool rather than
 * out of one shared pool (so a flashcard-heavy afternoon can't silently burn
 * the day's chat budget), and — Pro only — the things nothing else in this
 * category can do: knowing when you are free and knowing what your studying
 * is worth.
 *
 * Client-side checks here are for *presentation*: showing the right price, the
 * right meter, the right upsell. They are not the security boundary. The edge
 * functions re-derive the plan from the database on every call, because a
 * localStorage flag is not a payment. */
