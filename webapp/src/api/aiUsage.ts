/* How much of today's AI allowance the student has actually spent, per tool.
 *
 * The allowance itself is enforced server-side, in the edge function
 * (supabase/functions/learnora-ai/index.ts) — it counts this user's rows in
 * `ai_request_log`, filtered to the tool being called, since midnight UTC, and
 * answers 429 past that tool's limit. That is the boundary, and nothing here
 * is part of it: a number in the browser is not a limit, and this module must
 * never be mistaken for one.
 *
 * What was missing is the other half. The edge function computes the count,
 * uses it, and throws it away, so the first a student ever heard about the
 * allowance was the request that got refused — mid-task, with no warning that
 * it was coming. This reads the same rows the limiter reads, through the same
 * owner-only RLS policy, purely so the app can show the budget before it runs
 * out.
 *
 * Reading rather than mirroring is the point: there is one source of truth,
 * and the meter is a view of it. A locally-incremented counter would drift the
 * moment a request failed, a second tab was open, or the student came back on
 * their phone.
 *
 * One query, not ten: this fetches every row from today (a handful even for a
 * Pro account hammering every tool) and buckets them client-side, rather than
 * issuing a separate `count` request per tool. */
