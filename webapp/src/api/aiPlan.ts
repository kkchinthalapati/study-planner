/* Ports `AI.generateWeeklyPlan` from js/ai.js (:420-469).
 *
 * The prompt's task/exam lines are carried over verbatim — that half is the
 * thing the edge function's `mode: "plan"` instructions were tuned against,
 * and rewording it would silently change what the model returns for every
 * existing user. The weak-topics and adherence lines are new additions, not
 * a port: the vanilla never fed either back into planning, which meant a
 * regenerated plan was always a cold guess from tasks/exams alone, with no
 * memory of whether last week's plan actually happened or which topics
 * quizzes say the student is struggling with — even though both signals
 * already existed elsewhere (fetchWeakTopics powers the Dashboard's
 * "Struggling with" chips; study_sessions is what StreakCard reads).
 *
 * Two changes from the vanilla, both consequences of decisions already made:
 * it throws instead of showing a popup and returning null (Decision #6), and
 * it takes `settings` as an argument rather than reading `UI.loadSettings()`
 * off a global, so the caller passes whatever `SettingsProvider` currently
 * holds — including unsaved edits, which is what the vanilla did too.
