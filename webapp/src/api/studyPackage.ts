/* The unified creation pipeline — ports `AI.createStudyPackage` and its four
 * primitives (js/ai.js:472-826).
 *
 * Every notes document, flashcard deck and quiz in the app is produced here.
 * The vanilla's header explains why it exists at all: it replaced three
 * unrelated code paths reached from eight buttons, and an ingestion call that
 * asked one model request for Markdown *and* a JSON array at once and split
 * them on a token the model was free not to emit. Each primitive below asks
 * for exactly one kind of output in the matching edge mode, so a response
 * shape is never ambiguous.
 *
 * Three deliberate changes from the vanilla, each a consequence of a decision
 * already made on this branch:
 *
 *  1. `settings` is a parameter, not a `UI.loadSettings()` global read — same
 *     as `aiPlan.ts` and `aiQuiz.ts`.
 *  2. Failures are reported as structured `StageFailure`s instead of a bare
 *     `errors: string[]`, and a content refusal in a *later* stage no longer
 *     re-throws out of the whole run. The vanilla did re-throw (js/ai.js:784,
 *     :803), which threw away the reference to a deck that had already been
 *     generated and saved a moment earlier — the caller reported "Create
 *     failed" for a run that had in fact created something. Carrying the
 *     refusal message on the result keeps both facts.
 *  3. Untrusted text is fenced before it re-enters a prompt (`fenceUntrusted`),
 *     including the uploaded/pasted source itself. The vanilla interpolated a
 *     decoded document straight into the notes prompt (js/ai.js:535) — exactly
 *     the hole `lib/actionTags.ts` exists to close.
