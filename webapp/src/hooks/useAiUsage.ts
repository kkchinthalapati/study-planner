/* Today's AI allowance, joined to the plan that sets it — per tool.
 *
 * Two halves that live apart: how many generations have been spent, per tool
 * (rows in `ai_request_log`, bucketed client-side by `fetchDailyAiUsage`) and
 * how many are allowed per tool (a number that depends on the plan).
 * `useEntitlements().usage` already knows how to combine a used-count and a
 * plan into a `QuotaUsage`; `usageFor` is that call, closed over today's fetch,
 * for whichever tool a meter wants to show.
 *
 * `staleTime: 0` is deliberate against the app's 60s default. Everything else
 * cached here describes the student's own library, which only they change from
 * this tab; this describes a budget the server decrements on every AI call,
 * including calls made from another tab or another device. A meter that is a
 * minute stale is a meter that says "8 left" to someone who has none, which is
 * worse than no meter. `api/ai.ts` invalidates the key on every answered
 * request, so in practice this refetches when a number has actually moved.
