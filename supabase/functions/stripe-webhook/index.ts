/* The only thing in this system that can grant Pro.
 *
 * Follows `send-push-reminders`' machine-caller shape: no user JWT, because
 * there is no user — Stripe calls this. The service-role client is what lets it
 * write the billing columns that the `profiles` trigger blocks for everybody
 * else, and the signature check is what makes that safe. No CORS: a browser
 * has no business here.
 *
 * Two properties this file has to hold, both of which are easy to lose:
 *
 *   1. **Verified.** The body is checked against Stripe's signature before a
 *      single field of it is read. Without that, anyone who learns this URL can
 *      POST themselves a subscription.
 *   2. **Idempotent.** Stripe guarantees at-least-once delivery and retries for
 *      three days, so every event arrives more than once eventually. Each event
 *      id is recorded in `stripe_events` and a repeat is dropped.
 *
 * Deploy (note `--no-verify-jwt`: Stripe does not send a Supabase JWT, and the
 * default gateway check would reject every event before it reached this code):
 *
 *   supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook --no-verify-jwt
 *   supabase secrets set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
 *   supabase secrets set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
